# 11

In the previous two exercises, you developed functions that convert
simple numeric strings to signed integers.
In this exercise and the next, you're going to reverse those functions.

Write a function that converts a non-negative integer value
(e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on) to the string representation of that integer.

You may not use any of the standard conversion functions available
in JavaScript, such as String(), Number.prototype.toString, or an
expression such as '' + number. Your function should do this the
old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and
manipulating the number.

const DIGITS = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'];

function integerToString(number) {

  let result = '';

  do {
    // number = 4

    let remainder = number % 10;
    //  remainder = 4 % 10
    //  remainder = 4

    // for the while loop condition
    // so the while loop knows where to stop
    number = Math.floor(number / 10);
  //number = 4 / 10
  //number = 0.4
  //number = Math.floor(0.4)
  //number = 0


    result = DIGITS[remainder] + result;
  //result = DIGITS[4]         + '321'
  //result = '4'               + '321'
  //result = '4'               + '321'
  //result = '4321'

  //************************************************
  //result =   '4321'

  } while (number > 0);
  // 0 > 0 ---> false

  return result;
}



console.log(integerToString(4321));      // "4321"
console.log(integerToString(0));         // "0"
console.log(integerToString(5000));      // "5000"
console.log(integerToString(1234567890));      // "1234567890"

Discussion
The solution is somewhat similar to the stringToInteger function from earlier.

Like in stringToInteger, this solution also uses a lookup table, but this time we use an array. In building the DIGITS lookup table, we just need to be mindful to align the string value to the array index position, so that when we do something like DIGITS[5], we get the string representation of the index/number 5.

The tricky part of the solution is the "math" for getting the numbers digit by digit. The solution gets the rightmost digit (a one's digit) by getting the remainder of dividing the number by 10. For instance, 4321 % 10 returns 1. The solution then chops off the rightmost digit to get the next number by reassigning number to the result of Math.floor(number / 10). Consequently, the result string is incrementally built by prepending the looked-up value, using the remainder as the index, to the previous value of result. This process repeats until the value of number becomes 0.

The Built-in Method
For this exercise, we looked at the Number.prototype.toString method. Compared to its counterpart approach of prepending an empty string ('') to a number, using toString is more explicit. It can also be called directly on any number.

Copy Code
(17).toString();        // "17"
(17).toString(2);       // "10001"
(17).toString(16);      // "11"
Notice when using the built-in method that parentheses enclose the number. This is necessary so that the JavaScript interpreter knows to use the number primitive as a Number object. As an object, it can access the built-in methods of Number.prototype. JavaScript's built-in method is also more powerful than the one the solution implemented. toString can take a radix value as an optional argument. Using the radix value, this method can convert any number to any base from base 2 up to base 36.

One final note: the Airbnb Style Guide calls for using the constructor Function String() in preference to toString(). The reason for this is twofold:

String() works with all types, including null and undefined, while toString() raises an exception in those cases.
String() is guaranteed to return a string. This is not the case with toString() — individual objects can override toString() and they don't have to return a string.
